[**Neural Networks and System Simulation**](https://github.com/IsilEna/SignalProcessing/blob/main/signal_lab1_isilsonmez.pdf)
Here are my work in **MATLAB**.

This repository contains a report on neural networks and system simulation, covering topics such as:
Neuron models and activation functions (Linear functions, normalization, logsig)
Classification using neural networks (Categorizing data based on input features)
Performance analysis of neural networks (Impact of different parameters on learning)
Dynamic system modeling (Simulation of a mechanical system with varying stiffness and damping parameters)
