[**Neural Networks and System Simulation**](https://github.com/IsilEna/NeuralNetworksAndSystemSimulation/blob/main/Report_IsilSonmez.pdf)
Here are my work in **MATLAB**.

This repository contains a report on neural networks and system simulation, covering topics such as:

-Neuron models and activation functions (Linear functions, normalization, logsig)

-Classification using neural networks (Categorizing data based on input features)

-Performance analysis of neural networks (Impact of different parameters on learning)

-Dynamic system modeling (Simulation of a mechanical system with varying stiffness and damping parameters)
